## Cache

`--cache=<yes|no|auto>`

Decide whether to use network cache settings (default: auto).

If enabled, use up to `--cache-secs` for the cache size (but still limited
to `--demuxer-max-bytes`), and make the cached data seekable (if possible).
If disabled, `--cache-pause` and related are implicitly disabled.

The `auto` choice enables this depending on whether the stream is thought
to involve network accesses or other slow media (this is an imperfect
heuristic).

Before mpv 0.30.0, this used to accept a number, which specified the size
of the cache in kilobytes. Use e.g. `--cache --demuxer-max-bytes=123k`
instead.

`--cache-secs=<seconds>`

How many seconds of audio/video to prefetch if the cache is active. This
overrides the `--demuxer-readahead-secs` option if and only if the cache
is enabled and the value is larger. The default value is set to something
very high, so the actually achieved readahead will usually be limited by
the value of the `--demuxer-max-bytes` option. Setting this option is
usually only useful for limiting readahead.

`--cache-on-disk=<yes|no>`

Write packet data to a temporary file, instead of keeping them in memory.
This makes sense only with `--cache`. If the normal cache is disabled,
this option is ignored.

The cache file is append-only. Even if the player appears to prune data, the
file space freed by it is not reused. The cache file is deleted when
playback is closed.

Note that packet metadata is still kept in memory. `--demuxer-max-bytes`
and related options are applied to metadata *only*. The size of this
metadata  varies, but 50 MB per hour of media is typical. The cache
statistics will report this metadats size, instead of the size of the cache
file. If the metadata hits the size limits, the metadata is pruned (but not
the cache file).

When the media is closed, the cache file is deleted. A cache file is
generally worthless after the media is closed, and it's hard to retrieve
any media data from it (it's not supported by design).

If the option is enabled at runtime, the cache file is created, but old data
will remain in the memory cache. If the option is disabled at runtime, old
data remains in the disk cache, and the cache file is not closed until the
media is closed. If the option is disabled and enabled again, it will
continue to use the cache file that was opened first.

`--demuxer-cache-dir=

`

Directory where to create temporary files. Cache is stored in the system's
cache directory (usually `~/.cache/mpv`) if this is unset.

Currently, this is used for `--cache-on-disk` only.

`--cache-pause=<yes|no>`

Whether the player should automatically pause when the cache runs out of
data and stalls decoding/playback (default: yes). If enabled, it will
pause and unpause once more data is available, aka "buffering".

`--cache-pause-wait=<seconds>`

Number of seconds the packet cache should have buffered before starting
playback again if "buffering" was entered (default: 1). This can be used
to control how long the player rebuffers if `--cache-pause` is enabled,
and the demuxer underruns. If the given time is higher than the maximum
set with `--cache-secs` or  `--demuxer-readahead-secs`, or prefetching
ends before that for some other reason (like file end or maximum configured
cache size reached), playback resumes earlier.

`--cache-pause-initial=<yes|no>`

Enter "buffering" mode before starting playback (default: no). This can be
used to ensure playback starts smoothly, in exchange for waiting some time
to prefetch network data (as controlled by `--cache-pause-wait`). For
example, some common behavior is that playback starts, but network caches
immediately underrun when trying to decode more data as playback progresses.

Another thing that can happen is that the network prefetching is so CPU
demanding (due to demuxing in the background) that playback drops frames
at first. In these cases, it helps enabling this option, and setting
`--cache-secs` and `--cache-pause-wait` to roughly the same value.

This option also triggers when playback is restarted after seeking.

`--demuxer-cache-unlink-files=<immediate|whendone|no>`

Whether or when to unlink cache files (default: immediate). This affects
cache files which are inherently temporary, and which make no sense to
remain on disk after the player terminates. This is a debugging option.

`immediate`

Unlink cache file after they were created. The cache files won't be
visible anymore, even though they're in use. This ensures they are
guaranteed to be removed from disk when the player terminates, even if
it crashes.

`whendone`

Delete cache files after they are closed.

`no`

Don't delete cache files. They will consume disk space without having a
use.

Currently, this is used for `--cache-on-disk` only.

`--stream-buffer-size=<bytesize>`

Size of the low level stream byte buffer (default: 128KB). This is used as
buffer between demuxer and low level I/O (e.g. sockets). Generally, this
can be very small, and the main purpose is similar to the internal buffer
FILE in the C standard library will have.

Half of the buffer is always used for guaranteed seek back, which is
important for unseekable input.

There are known cases where this can help performance to set a large buffer:

> - mp4 files. libavformat may trigger many small seeks in both
> directions, depending on how the file was muxed.
>
> - Certain network filesystems, which do not have a cache, and where
> small reads can be inefficient.

In other cases, setting this to a large value can reduce performance.

Usually, read accesses are at half the buffer size, but it may happen that
accesses are done alternating with smaller and larger sizes (this is due to
the internal ring buffer wrap-around).

See `--list-options` for defaults and value range. `<bytesize>` options
accept suffixes such as `KiB` and `MiB`.

`--vd-queue-enable=<yes|no>, --ad-queue-enable`

Enable running the video/audio decoder on a separate thread (default: no).
If enabled, the decoder is run on a separate thread, and a frame queue is
put between decoder and higher level playback logic. The size of the frame
queue is defined by the other options below.

This is probably quite pointless. libavcodec already has multithreaded
decoding (enabled by default), which makes this largely unnecessary. It
might help in some corner cases with high bandwidth video that is slow to
decode (in these cases libavcodec would block the playback logic, while
using a decoding thread would distribute the decoding time evenly without
affecting the playback logic). In other situations, it will simply make
seeking slower and use significantly more memory.

The queue size is restricted by the other `--vd-queue-...` options. The
final queue size is the minimum as indicated by the option with the lowest
limit. Each decoder/track has its own queue that may use the full configured
queue size.

Most queue options can be changed at runtime. `--vd-queue-enable` itself
(and the audio equivalent) update only if decoding is completely
reinitialized. However, setting `--vd-queue-max-samples=1` should almost
lead to the same behavior as `--vd-queue-enable=no`, so that value can
be used for effectively runtime enabling/disabling the queue.

This should not be used with hardware decoding. It is possible to enable
this for audio, but it makes even less sense.

`--vd-queue-max-bytes=<bytesize>`, `--ad-queue-max-bytes`

Maximum approximate allowed size of the queue. If exceeded, decoding will
be stopped. The maximum size can be exceeded by about 1 frame.

See `--list-options` for defaults and value range. `<bytesize>` options
accept suffixes such as `KiB` and `MiB`.

`--vd-queue-max-samples=<int>`, `--ad-queue-max-samples`

Maximum number of frames (video) or samples (audio) of the queue. The audio
size may be exceeded by about 1 frame.

See `--list-options` for defaults and value range.

`--vd-queue-max-secs=<seconds>`, `--ad-queue-max-secs`

Maximum number of seconds of media in the queue. The special value 0 means
no limit is set. The queue size may be exceeded by about 2 frames. Timestamp
resets may lead to random queue size usage.
